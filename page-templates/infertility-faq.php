		<p>PGS allows patients the highest chance of success (a live birth) with each embryo transfer.Regardless of age, a chromosomally normal embryo has about a 50% chance of live birth. This allows us greater confidence with each embryo transfer such that most patients transfer only one embryo at a time. Keep in mind that while PGS helps us more easily identify the healthiest embryos to transfer (resulting in a higher live birth rate per transfer), it does not increase the chances overall.
		<br><br> <em> <strong>The Pros</strong>: Highest implantation and live birth rate per transfer ; fewer miscarriages ; and you are less likely to experience (and pay for) an unsuccessful embryo transfer.<br> </em> <strong>The Cons</strong>: Costs more cost upfront in order to perform the procedure on the embryos and genetic analysis on sampled cells and although this procedure is considered safe and effective, there remains an approximate 8-10% risk of discarding a normal embryo.
		<br><br> Lastly, it’s important to understand that with PGS, it’s possible that you will not have any normal embryos to transfer. Although this is very disappointing to experience, it also means that a you did not have to endure a transfer that resulted in a miscarriage, with the associated pain and lost time before a successful transfer. </p>

		<p>We take enormous pride in delivering the highest chances of successful IVF, anywhere. Your success will depend greatly on your age at the time your eggs are retrieved. Nationally, women under 35 have nearly 50% success rates, while women over 42 have a 5% chance of success with each attempt using her own eggs. As women age, the number of eggs available declines and the miscarriage risk increases due to ovarian aging, making it harder to conceive. Many women require multiple attempts with IVF. Our job is to help you achieve a live birth in as few attempts as possible.*Although aging is the biggest predictor of success, this is due to the age of the eggs and not the uterus. Success rates with donor eggs are over 50% per attempt and depend on the fertility and age of the egg donor.</p>

		<br><br>It’s important to note that not all causes are due to female factors. In fact, 30-40% of infertility cases are due to male factors. We need enough motile, swimming sperm to fertilize an egg. A “normal” ejaculate has over 18 million motile (swimming) sperm. Some men produce fewer or no sperm. Other men produce plenty of sperm but have obstructions in their tubes (the vas deferens), preventing sperm from being released. Just because a semen sample appears normal, doesn’t mean that there are sufficient numbers of sperm inside. We need to check with a microscope.</p>

		<p>A woman’s ovarian reserve is directly related to her ager and refers to her potential to produce multiple eggs with ovarian stimulation. Ovarian reserve, or egg supply, begins to gradually decline beginning at the age of 30. The amount of medication required to stimulate her ovaries will increase and the number of follicles and eggs produced from her ovaries declines. These factors lower a woman’s chances of pregnancy with our best treatments. Several tests are used to determine a woman’s fertility potential, including blood tests such as Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH), FSH and Estradiol and a pelvic ultrasound to evaluate Antral Follicle Count.</p>

		<p>The long answer is that the optimal number to ensure a single healthy pregnancy varies by age, reproductive history (have you been pregnant before?), and other factors that could make it easier or harder to get pregnant in the future.
		<br><br>The short answer: we recommend having at least 20 mature eggs frozen before your 37th birthday. Why? The largest study to date looking at the average number of mature eggs needed per live birth in patients using IVF suggested that 20 egg were needed, up until age 37. Beyond 37 the number was higher (about 40 eggs per baby at age 40 and 60 eggs by age 42). These numbers correlate very well with the national IVF success rates in the United States, as reported by the CDC.</p>

		<p>Although there are several molecular tests of uterine receptiveness, most current tests not very predictive. The most important tool right now is to make sure the uterus is free of any lesions like polyps or fibroids. This is best done by either a Sonohysterogram, also known as a Saline Infusion Sonogram (SIS) or hysteroscopy. Occasionally, an endometrial biopsy can be performed to rule out chronic infections, or to perform experimental molecular testing.</p>

		<p> For men, the evaluation is even simpler. We perform a Semen Analysis to see if there are enough motile (swimming) sperm to reach and fertilize an egg. Low or absent sperm counts can be due to problems producing sperm or in a blockage preventing the sperm from being released. Appearing to ejaculate normally does not mean there are enough quality sperm being emitted.
		<br><br> The basic male evaluation can be addressed with two key questions:
		<br><br> <strong>Do you produce a sufficient number of “swimming” sperm to total sperm?</strong>
		<br>Fertile men typically produce tens of millions of sperm per ejaculate. It’s not enough to produce sperm; the job isn’t done until they reach the egg and fertilize it. Unfortunately, it’s a long journey, and therefore nature provides millions of sperm in the hope that one is able to make it to the egg, attach and fertilize.
		<br><br> <strong>Are the sperm able to leave your body?</strong>
		<br> Just as women have tubes that can be blocked (the fallopian tubes), the same is also true with men. The vas deferens is the tube that carries sperm from the testes to the penis. Sometimes these tubes can be blocked or congenitally absent. With an obstructed vas deferens, a man’s ejaculation may appear normal but lack sperm.
		<br><br> We evaluate sperm with a Semen Analysis, which tests the percent motility, or the number of sperm per ejaculation. We also examine direction and speed, shape, and other factors that can give your doctors insight into your ability to conceive without assistance.</p>

	</div>
	<div id="c-13" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="h-13">
	  <div class="panel-body">
		<p> Several recent studies have been published that suggest frozen embryos may have higher pregnancy and live birth rates and may even have better live birth outcomes. Our interpretation: For some patients a frozen embryo transfer is going to be safer and result in a higher pregnancy rate. However, not all patients benefit from this approach so we do not recommend freezing all embryos to every patient. We believe we can identify the patients who will benefit from a “freeze all” approach and frozen embryo transfer during their monitoring. In these cases, we recommend cryopreserving all of your embryos without transferring them in order to increase your chance of a successful and healthy pregnancy.
		<br><br> <strong>Reasons we might cryopreserve without transferring an embryo:</strong>
		<br><br> <em> <strong>Elevated early progesterone.</strong> The uterus has a “window of receptivity” when it will allow a good embryo to implant.  Before and after that window, even a good embryo won’t be successful. Sometimes, the elevated hormone levels seen with ovarian stimulation can “confuse” the uterus into thinking the embryo will be arriving before it is ready. By the time the embryos arrive, the uterus is not receptive to implantation. So, instead of transferring a good embryo into a uterus that is no longer “receptive,” we’ll wait and use a frozen embryo when the timing is better <br> <strong>New concerns about the uterine lining.</strong> Rarely, we detect a new polyp or bleeding that was missed before starting the IVF process.  <br> <strong>Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.</strong> In patients who produce many eggs and embryos, ovaries can become hyperstimulated and need time to ‘cool down’ to allow for successful implantation. This is quite rare, and although it’s disappointing to experience an unplanned delay, it usually means there’s a good chance at a successful pregnancy the next month with a frozen embryo transfer.  <br> <em>*Patient choice.</em></em> One of the most common reasons is that a patient or couple wants to create embryos to transfer later, either for medical or personal reasons. </p>

		<p>Embryo freezing has been performed since the 1980s. Sperm cryopreservation has been successfully performed since the 1970s. We have seen many births from embryos cryopreserved for over 10 years and even some births from sperm cryopreserved for as long as 19 years. Animal studies suggest that cryopreservation is possible for even longer without detectable consequences but beyond 10-15 years, our experience is limited.</p>

	  <div class="panel-body">
		<p>One decision we’ll consider together is whether you’ll want to do a natural or controlled (medicated) frozen embryo transfer.
		<br><br> If you’ve decided to get genetic testing or are otherwise using frozen embryos, then we’ll work with you to time your transfer. Compared to a “fresh” IVF cycle with ovarian stimulation, a frozen embryo transfer is much easier. Depending on your preferences for timing and your medical history, we can do a controlled cycle or a natural cycle.
		<br><br> <strong>Controlled Cycle:</strong> We give you medications to prevent your body from ovulating. We provide all the estrogen and progesterone you need for about 10 weeks.
		<br> <strong>Advantages:</strong> You can schedule the transfer to your convenience and have more control over the process.
		<br> <strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Cost and inconvenience of taking medications for 10 weeks.
		<br><br> <strong>Natural Cycle:</strong> We allow your body to ovulate on its own. As a result, you produce your own estrogen and progesterone and require minimal additional medication.
		<br> <strong>Advantages:</strong> Lower cost of medication.
		<br><em> <em>*Disadvantages:</em></em> There is more initial monitoring to make sure we know when you ovulate and as such, it’s more unpredictable. We cannot control the exact date of the embryo transfer, since your body will ultimately determine when we need to transfer the embryo. We are also unable to give supplemental estradiol before you ovulate, so patients with thin lining may do better with a controlled cycle to supplement endometrial growth.</p>

		<p>We believe in simple, transparent pricing. Our self-pay packages include anesthesia and intend to be comprehensive, except for medications (since we are not a pharmacy). Insurance coverage can make pricing more confusing since different plans have different deductibles and coinsurance. We will help you navigate your benefits and understand the anticipated costs to you. Since there are multiple options for different treatment protocols, it’s best to talk to one of our financial counselors about your specific case.</p>
